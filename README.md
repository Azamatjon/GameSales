Firstly we had no imagine what to do. We had only data and laptop, so first task for us is come what to do? Do descriptive or predict something? And in progress of searching of new idea, we learned different things related to data, as libraries in python, R language which is very comfortable for use, but python has more space for coding, building charts. Our data undarstanding improoved to next level. However it stays difficult for us to write report this was the most difficult part of project. We're going to learn more about documentation and data processing. For future we're going do it better and add machine learning and automotized learning for our projects.
